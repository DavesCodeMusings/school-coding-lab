# Code Editors
Before you can run code, you have to write code. For that, you need a code editor. There are many choices, but for Python and MicroPython, the two popular options are Thonny and Visual Studio Code.

## Thonny
The Raspberry Pi OS comes with a nice beginner-friendly code editor built in. It's called Thonny and it works really well with Python and MicroPython. Thonny can be accessed from the Raspberry Pi OS application menu as shown in the screenshot below.

To learn more about Thonny and how to use it, see the Thonny home page at https://thonny.org

## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor for many programming languages. It does not come pre-installed in Raspberry Pi OS, so there is a little work to do if you want to use it. Though once it's installed, you'll be able to access it on the Raspberry Pi OS application menu, just like Thonny.

It should be noted, Visual Studio Code is more resource intensive than Thonny and your experience on older Raspberry Pi 3 hardware will be less than stellar.

If you have a newer Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 and want to try it out, see the [instructions for installing VS Code].
