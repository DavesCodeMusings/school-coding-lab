        After the Traffic Light Controller seminar, the traffic light vendor
        has been getting a lot of follow-up questions asking about GPIOs and
        what else they can do besides making the traffic light module's LEDs
        light up. If there's enough interest, they've agreed to offer another
        seminar on microcontroller GPIOs.

            We had a really good turn out for the traffic light hardware
            cross-training seminar. And a lot of folks wanted to learn more,
            particularly about the the microcontroller GPIOs and how they
            work. The traffic light manufacturer has agreed to host another
            seminar and the mayor's office says there's money in the budget.
            So once again, we're opening this up to the hardware team and
            software developers alike.

    <h2>Using the Built-In NeoPixel as a Walk / Don't Walk Signal</h2>

    <p>
        So far we've been using GPIOs to controll the red, yellow, green
        LED traffic light module plugged into the breadboard. There's also
        an LED module built directly onto the ESP32-C3 board. It's called
        a NeoPixel and it can display a variety of colors using only a
        single GPIO connection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the photos below. Compare them to the ESP32-C3
        microcontroller board you're working with and see if you can
        locate the NeoPixel. It's the white square with a clear, round
        area in the middle.
    </p>

        <figcaption>ESP32-C3 NeoPixel viewed from above and close up.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Notice the white text printed below. It has some imperfections,
        but it reads: <i>RGB@IO8</i>. IO8 refers to GPIO number 8. (There's
        not a lot of space, so the GP part of GPIO is left off.) This label
        tells us the ESP32-C3's built-in NeoPixel is controlled by GPIO 8.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the MicroPython code sample below.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from neopixel import NeoPixel
from time import sleep

walk_signal = NeoPixel(Pin(8), 1)

while True:
    walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)
    walk_signal.write()
    sleep(5)

    walk_signal[0] = (255, 255, 255)
    walk_signal.write()
    sleep(5)
        </code>
        <figcaption>Sample code to cycle between walk and don't walk every five seconds.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        This code sample lights up the NeoPixel in red to represent
        <i>don't walk</i> and white to represent <i>walk</i>. Use the
        Raspberry Pi development workstation to run the code on your
        ESP32-C3 and watch what happens.

    <h2>NeoPixel vs. Traditional LED</h2>

    <p>
        The MicroPython code for the NeoPixel walk signal looks a lot
        like the flashing red traffic light from the first activity.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There's some module import statements at the top.</li>
        <li>There's a variable that uses the Pin class.</li>
        <li>There's a while loop that changes LED colors, with sleep statements to pause.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But, there are differences as well.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The import line <code>from neopixel import NeoPixel</code> is new.</li>
        <li>There's no more <code>.on()</code> and <code>.off()</code> to control the LED.</li>
        <li>The variable names red, yellow, and green have all been removed</li>
        <li>The <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)</code> statement is new, as is <code>walk_signal.write()</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        So why all these changes?
    </p>

    <p>
        Very simply, the NeoPixel needs an external module because it
        has a controller chip built into it. (Look closely at the NeoPixel
        when it's off and you can see a tiny dark square inside the round
        part.) The module provides the software routines that communicate
        with the NeoPixel controller.
    </p>

    <p>
        The controller chip and software module are needed because the
        NeoPixel actually has three LEDs built into it, red, green, and
        blue. (Remember the RGB label printed on the microcontroller
        board? RGB stands for red, green, blue.) The controller chip
        together with the software module can also control the brightness
        of each of these three built-in LEDs. And all of this is done
        using a single GPIO pin.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the code sample, focusing on the lines in the while
        loop. (See below.) Notice the <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)</code>
        and <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 255, 255)</code> statements. This
        is what sets the NeoPixel to red and white, respectively. The three
        numbers represent the brightness of the individual red, green, and
        blue LEDs. (Red, green, and blue light combined makes white.)
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)
    walk_signal.write()
    sleep(5)

    walk_signal[0] = (255, 255, 255)
    walk_signal.write()
    sleep(5)
        </code>
        <figcaption>The while loop portion of the MicroPython code.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Try making some temporary changes to the code to make the NeoPixel
        cycle between red and green instead of red and white.
    </p>

    <details class="help">
        <summary>Click here if you need a hint.</summary>

        <p>
            Here's a few hints:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The lines that set the color of the NeoPixel are:
                <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)</code> and
                <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 255, 255)</code>
            </li>

            <li>
                Recall that the color values are red, green, and blue,
                respectively. So you can think of it like this:
                <code>walk_signal[0] = (RED, GREEN, BLUE)</code>
            </li>

            <li>
                The line <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)</code> changes
                the NeoPixel to red at maximum brightness.
            </li>

            <li>
                Replacing <code>walk_signal[0] = (255, 255, 255)</code>
                with <code>walk_signal[0] = (0, 255, 0)</code> will change
                the NeoPixel to green instead of white.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <p>
        Have some fun experimenting with different color combinations.
        Be sure to change the code back to red and white when you're
        done so you're ready for the next part.
    </p>

    <h2>Synchronizing the Walk Signal with the Traffic Light</h2>

    <p>
        As the program is configured now, it just cycles the NeoPixel
        from red (don't walk) to white (walk) over and over again in
        an endless loop. The traffic signal isn't doing anything at
        all in this example. For this next part, we'll look at what
        it would take to bring back the traffic light and make it work
        together with the walk signal.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, let's review the code that cycles the traffic light
        LEDs between red, green, and yellow signals.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
yellow = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
green = Pin(6, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(5)

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.on()
    sleep(4)

    red.off()
    yellow.on()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>
        <figcaption>MicroPython Code to control the traffic light LEDs</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Now, compare it to the walk signal code shown below.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from neopixel import NeoPixel
from time import sleep

walk_signal = NeoPixel(Pin(8), 1)

while True:
    walk_signal[0] = (255, 0, 0)
    walk_signal.write()
    sleep(5)

    walk_signal[0] = (255, 255, 255)
    walk_signal.write()
    sleep(5)
        </code>
        <figcaption>MicroPython code to control the walk signal NeoPixel.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Notice the similarities and differences between the two programs.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Both have module import statements, but the walk signal requires an extra one for the NeoPixel.</li>
        <li>Both have while loops, but the traffic light cycles through three colors while the walk signal cycles through two.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        See if you can combine the two programs into a new one. The new
        code should only turn on the walk signal only when traffic is
        stopped at a red light. When the traffic signal is showing green
        or yellow, the walk sign should show red for don't walk.
