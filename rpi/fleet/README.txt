This is where you will find automation for help with managing multiple
Raspberry Pi development hosts while minimizing manual tasks.

To get started, see Fleet-HOWTO.md in the /docs/rpi/fleet directory.

If you're going to skip the HOWTO document and dive right in, run things in
the following order:

* bash install_ansible.sh
* Either ansible-playbook configure_dev_workstaiton.yml or ansible-playbook configure_wifi_ap.yml
