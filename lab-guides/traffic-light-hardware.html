    <p>
        Remember the incident with all the traffic lights in the city
        stuck on flashing red? Well, according to recent polls, sixty-eight
        percent of the voting age population does too. So the mayor's
        office wants everyone in the transportation department to learn
        more about the traffic light system. That way, when something like
        this happens again, it can be fixed before it becomes headline news.

            I'm sure you've heard about the cross-training initiative being
            asked for by the mayor's office. All the folks on my hardware
            team have already started an online course for Python and Visual
            Studio Code. While that's going on, I've got people on site from
            the traffic light manufacturer to offer a hands-on seminar
            covering the basics of their hardware. We're inviting all the
            software developers to attend.

    <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The traffic light system consists of red, yellow, and green LEDs
        attached to an ESP32C3 microcontroller. There are four connector
        pins on the traffic light. One for red, one for yellow, one for
        green, and a common ground pin. Each the LED pins is connected
        to a General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) pin on the ESP32C3
        microcontroller. This is how the microcontroller turns the LEDs
        on and off.

    <h3>Hardware from a Software Perspective</h3>

    <p>
        For review, the code that runs the traffic light system is shown
        below. It should look familiar from your previous work on fixing
        the flashing red light problem.
    </p>

    <figure>
    <!-- All whitespace is rendered as-is in the code-block. This includes leading indents. -->
       <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
yellow = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
green = Pin(6, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(5)

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.on()
    sleep(4)

    red.off()
    yellow.on()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>

        <figcaption>MicroPython code to cycle a traffic light through red, green, yellow.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Last time you worked on the application, you spent your time looking
        at the code in the <i>while loop</i> (the indented lines after
        <code>while True:</code>) Everything above <code>while True:</code>
        was ignored since it did not affect the timing of the lights.
    </p>

    <p>
        This time around, we're going to look at the first few lines. This
        is the code that sets up the hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are the relevant lines:
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin

red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
yellow = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
green = Pin(6, Pin.OUT)        
        </code>

        <figcaption>Lines of code used setup the GPIO pins.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        The first line, <code>from machine import Pin</code>, tells
        MicroPython to load the <i>Pin</i> class from the <i>machine</i>
        module. A <i>class</i> is a predefined chunk of code you can use
        in your applications. A <i>module</i> is a collection of those
        predefined code chunks. You'll find lines like this in nearly
        every MicroPython you see.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <i>Pin</i> class is used three times: once for the red LED,
        again for the yellow, and finally for the green. Furthermore,
        each use of <i>Pin</i> gives a pin number (4, 5, or 6) and a
        direction (Pin.OUT). This is how the MicroPython software
        communicates with the ESP32C3 hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice how the line with <code>from time import sleep</code> has
        been omitted from this example. That's because it controls timing
        of the light sequence and has no bearing on the hardware setup.
    </p>

    <p>
        These four lines of MicroPython set up the the GPIO pins in the
        software. Now let's see what it looks like from the hardware side.
    </p>

    <h3>GPIO Pins from the Microcontroller Perspective</h3>

    <p>
        Below is a picture of the ESP32C3 microcontroller with labels
        added on the pins used to control the traffic light LED. There
        are three GPIO pins and one ground reference.
