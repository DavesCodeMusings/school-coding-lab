        After the Traffic Light Controller seminar, the traffic light vendor
        has been getting a lot of follow-up questions asking about GPIOs and
        what else they can do besides making the traffic light module's LEDs
        light up. If there's enough interest, they've agreed to offer another
        seminar on microcontroller GPIOs.

            We had a really good turn out for the traffic light hardware
            cross-training seminar. And a lot of folks wanted to learn more,
            particularly about the the microcontroller GPIOs and how they
            work. The traffic light manufacturer has agreed to host another
            seminar and the mayor's office says there's money in the budget.
            So once again, we're opening this up to the hardware team and
            software developers alike.

    <h2>Using the Built-In NeoPixel as a Walk / Don't Walk Signal</h2>

    <p>
        So far we've been using GPIOs to controll the red, yellow, green
        LED traffic light module plugged into the breadboard. There's also
        an LED module built directly onto the ESP32-C3 board. It's called
        a NeoPixel and it can display a variety of colors using only a
        single GPIO connection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the photos below. Compare them to the ESP32-C3
        microcontroller board you're working with and see if you can
        locate the NeoPixel. It's the white square with a clear, round
        area in the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice the white text printed below. It has some imperfections,
        but it reads: <i>RGB@IO8</i>. IO8 refers to GPIO number 8. (There's
        not a lot of space, so the GP part of GPIO is left off.) This label
        tells us the ESP32-C3's built-in NeoPixel is controlled by GPIO 8.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the MicroPython code sample below.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from neopixel import NeoPixel
from time import sleep

np = NeoPixel(Pin(8), 1)

while True:
    np[0] = (255, 0, 0)
    np.write()
    sleep(5)
    np[0] = (255, 255, 255)
    np.write()
    sleep(5)
        </code>
        <figcaption>Sample code to cycle between walk and don't walk every five seconds.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        This code sample lights up the NeoPixel in red to represent
        <i>don't walk</i> and white to represent <i>walk</i>. Use the
        Raspberry Pi development workstation to run the code on your
        ESP32-C3.

    <h2>NeoPixel vs. Traditional LED</h2>

    <p>
        The MicroPython code for the NeoPixel walk signal looks a lot
        like the flashing red traffic light from the first activity.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There's some module import statements at the top.</li>
        <li>There's a variable that uses the Pin class.</li>
        <li>There's a while loop that changes LED colors, with sleep statements to pause.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But, there are differences as well.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The import line <code>from neopixel import NeoPixel</code> is new.</li>
        <li>There's no <code>.on()</code> and <code>.off()</code> to control the LED.</li>
        <li>The <code>np[0] = (255, 0, 0)</code> statement is new, as is <code>np.write()</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Very simply, the NeoPixel needs an external module because it
        has a controller chip built into it. (Look closely at the NeoPixel
        when it's off and you can see a tiny dark square inside the round
        part.) The module provides the software routines that communicate
        with the NeoPixel controller.
    </p>

    <p>
        The controller and module are needed because the NeoPixel actually
        has three LEDs built into it, red, green, and blue. (Remember the
        RGB label printed on the microcontroller board? RGB is for red,
        green, blue.) It can also control the brightness of each of these
        three built-in LEDs. All of this is done with a single GPIO.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a look at the code sample, but just the lines in the while
        loop. Notice the <code>np[0] = (255, 0, 0)</code> and
        <code>np[0] = (255, 255, 255)</code> statements. This is what
        sets the NeoPixel to red and white, respectively. The three
        numbers represent the brightness of the individual LEDs.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    np[0] = (255, 0, 0)
    np.write()
    sleep(5)
    np[0] = (255, 255, 255)
    np.write()
    sleep(5)
        </code>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Try making some temporary changes to the code to make the NeoPixel
        cycle between red and green instead of red and white.
    </p>

    <h2>Synchronizing the Walk Signal with the Traffic Light</h2>

    <p>
        As the program is configured now, it just cycles the NeoPixel
        from red (don't walk) to white (walk) over and over again in
        an endless loop. The traffic signal isn't doing anything at
        all in this example. For this next part, we'll look at what
        it would take to bring back the traffic light and make it work
        together with the walk signal.
