            I'm sure you've heard about the cross-training initiative being
            asked for by the mayor's office. All the folks on my hardware
            team have started an online course for Python and Visual Studio
            Code. While that's going on, I've got people from the traffic
            light manufacturer here to offer a hands-on seminar covering
            the basics of their hardware. We're inviting all the software
            developers to attend.

    <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The traffic light system consists of red, yellow, and green LEDs
        attached to an ESP32C3 microcontroller. There are four connector
        pins on the traffic light. One for red, one for yellow, one for
        green, and a common ground pin. Each the LED pins is connected
        to a General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) pin on the ESP32C3
        microcontroller. In this activity, we'll look at how the GPIO
        hardware connections and software functions work together to let
        the microcontroller turn the traffic light LEDs on and off.

    <h3>Hardware from a Software Perspective</h3>

    <p>
        For review, the code that runs the traffic light system is shown
        below. It should look familiar from your previous work on fixing
        the flashing red light problem.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <!-- All whitespace is rendered as-is in the code-block. This includes leading indents. -->
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
yellow = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
green = Pin(6, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(5)

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.on()
    sleep(4)

    red.off()
    yellow.on()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>

        <figcaption>MicroPython code to cycle a traffic light through red, green, yellow.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Last time you worked on the application, you spent your time looking
        at the code in the <i>while loop</i> (the indented lines after
        <code>while True:</code>) Everything above <code>while True:</code>
        was ignored since it did not affect the timing of the lights.
    </p>

    <p>
        This time around, we're going to look at the first few lines. This
        is the code that sets up the hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are the relevant lines:
    </p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin

red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
yellow = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
green = Pin(6, Pin.OUT)        
        </code>

        <figcaption>Lines of code used setup the GPIO pins.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        The first line, <code>from machine import Pin</code>, tells
        MicroPython to load the <i>Pin</i> class from the <i>machine</i>
        module. A <i>class</i> is a predefined chunk of code you can use
        in your applications. A <i>module</i> is a collection of those
        predefined code chunks. You'll find lines like this in nearly
        every MicroPython you see.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <i>Pin</i> class is used three times: once for the red LED,
        again for the yellow, and finally for the green. Furthermore,
        each use of <i>Pin</i> gives a pin number (4, 5, or 6) and a
        direction (Pin.OUT). This is how the MicroPython software
        communicates with the ESP32C3 hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice how the line with <code>from time import sleep</code> has
        been omitted from this example. That's because it controls timing
        of the light sequence and has no bearing on the hardware setup.
    </p>

    <p>
        These four lines of MicroPython set up the the GPIO pins in the
        software. Now let's see what it looks like from the hardware side.
    </p>

    <h3>GPIO Pins from the Microcontroller Perspective</h3>

    <p>
        Below is a picture of the ESP32C3 microcontroller with labels
        added pointing to the pins used to control the traffic light LED.
        In this configuration, there are three GPIO pins and one ground
        reference attached to the LED module.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <img id="gpio" alt="ESP32C3 DevkitC-02 with relevant GPIO and ground pins labeled."
            src="images/traffic-light-gpio.jpg" onmouseover="imageSwap(this.id, 'images/traffic-light-gpio-zoomed.jpg')"
            onmouseout="imageSwap(this.id, 'images/traffic-light-gpio.jpg')">
        <figcaption>GPIO pins used for the traffic light.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Notice how the pins are also labeled with white printing on the
        microcontroller board itself. The printed numbers are slightly
        offset to make use of the available space. The actual GPIO pin
        is the shiny silver metal bit beside it.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you write MicroPython code that has a line like,
        <code>red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)</code>, you're referring to a GPIO pin
        on the microcontroller board. Pin 4 in this case. The LED module is
        situated in so a pin connected to its red LED is plugged into the
        same place as GPIO 4 on the microcontroller. This is why the
        MicroPython code is written so <i>red</i> is equal to <i>Pin 4</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Have a look at the traffic light code and see if you can figure
        out which GPIO pins on the microcontroller board connect to the
        yellow and green LEDs. Fill in your answers in the table below.

    <h2>GPIO Voltages</h2>

    <p>
        If you have access to a multimeter, use it to measure the voltage
        at the GPIO pins while the traffic light program is running.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Set the multimeter to measure DC voltage in the 0 to 20v range.</li>
        <li>Touch the meter's common (black) lead to one of the microcontroller's ground pins (labeled G on the board.)
        </li>
        <li>Touch red lead of the multimeter to the GPIO 4 pin on the microcontroller.</li>
        <li>Determine what the voltage is when the LED is on and what it is when the LED is off.</li>
        <li>Repeat the measurements for GPIO pins 5 (yellow LED) and 6 (green LED.)</li>
        <li>Record the voltage measured as the program runs.</li>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            The voltage should be 3.3 volts whenever the GPIO is in the
            on state and the LED is illuminated. GPIO voltage should be
            0 volts when it's off. Measurements with the multimeter may
            not be exact, but they should be close, within 10% or so.
        </p>
    </details>

    <p>
        If you have a sharp eye, you may have noticed some of the other
        pins labeled on the ESP32-C3 board. Specifically 3V3 and G. These
        labels are for 3.3 volts and ground (or 0 volts). When you set a
        GPIO to on using something like <code>red.on()</code> in your
        program, it's changing the voltage on the GPIO 4 pin to 3.3 volts.
        When you set it to off, with <code>red.off()</code>, the voltage
        on the GPIO 4 pin becomes 0 volts.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is how the program can make the LEDs light up. The software
        tells the microcontroller to turn the GPIO on. The microcontroller
        switches the GPIO pin voltage to 3.3 volts. This causes current to
        flow through the LED and the LED turns on.
