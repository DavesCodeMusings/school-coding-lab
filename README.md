# School Coding Lab
_Creating a student development environment on the cheap!_

This repository is a combination of documentation and code, and it's all about building a computing environment for hands-on learning.

If you want to build a coding lab in your school, start with the [documentation](https://davescodemusings.github.io/school-coding-lab/) to discover how it all works.

If you already have a development machine and some microcontrollers, go straight to [the microcontroller labs](https://davescodemusings.github.io/school-coding-lab/labs/) and start coding.

Everything here is released to the Public Domain. Use it, modify it, or remix it to your heart's content.
