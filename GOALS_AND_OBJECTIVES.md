# Project Goals and Objectives
To keep the process of creating a student-build coding lab manageable and successful, the project is broken into phases. Goals, objectives, and a high-level overview of these phases are detailed below.

## Phase 1: Pilot Group

Goal: Test development workstation configuration and MicroPython labs.

Objective: Have a working lab for two groups of students working in pairs.

Three Raspberry Pis are needed.
* Two configured as Developer Workstations
* One configured as isolated WiFi access point

Two ESP32Cs -- one microcontroller USB-attached to each Dev Workstation.

Volunteer does initial hardware and software setup. Students work on MicroPython labs for Hello World and flashing LEDs on GPIOs.

Note any problems with setup, particularly when interfacing with school technology.
* Can students get to labs online or is the site blocked?
* Can students connect their Chromebooks to Pi-based WiFi access point?
* Is there sufficient physical space available for a permanent setup? Is the space secure?
* Is any of the lab hardware or software missing or lacking? 

## Phase 2: Pilot Remediation and Refinement

Goal: A better understanding of technology and process needs prior to expansion.

Objective: Create a punch list of things that went wrong in phase one and fix them.

Volunteer and sponsoring teacher work with the pilot group students to:
* Determine anything standing in the way of future MicroPython labs.
* Suggest possible solutions and workarounds.

Volunteer and teacher work with school staff (and possibly community groups) to implement solutions. For solutions that require funding, search for available grant money.

## Phase 3: Advanced Lab Pilot

Goal: Ensure students are comfortable with wiring microcontroller sensors and writing software for them.

Objective: Students are able to create a weather station with temp/humidity display or other intermediate-level lab.

Volunteer assists students when working on more complex labs.

Volunteer and sponsoring teacher note any shortcomings in lab documents and provide possible fixes.

Students test fixes while working on more complex labs.

## Phase 4: Hand-Off to Students

Goal: Make the advanced pilot group technology self-sufficient.

Objective: Pilot students are able to maintain the lab and troubleshoot common problems with lab hardware and software.

Volunteer woks with students and teacher to understand:
* Raspberry Pi hardware and OS
* Automation used to configure OS
* How to connect to Pi-based WiFi and its limitations
* Software used to program microcontrollers
* How to flash updated firmware to microcontrollers

## Phase 5: Student Ambassadors

Goal: Give more students the opportunity to have their own lab.

Objective: Pilot group students teach others how to build their own lab.

Volunteer works with students to:
* Identify and sort donated Raspberry Pi hardware
* Make a list of hardware needs
* Prepare and configure hardware and OS using automation

Volunteer and students work with sponsoring teacher to:
* Make connections with other schools
* Secure grant money for needed supplies
* Coordinate online meetings with other groups

## Phase 6: Process Improvements and Next Steps

Goal: Let student groups determine the direction of their lab.

Objective: Students are free to build, tear down, and experiment in a safe environment.

Sponsoring teacher works with student to solicit ideas about:
* What went well?
* What can be improved?
* How can we make those improvements?

Volunteer advises on technological aspects, automation, and overall feasibility.

Students present a plan and a list of funding needs.
