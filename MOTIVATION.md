# What's my motivation?

Chromebooks make me sad.

This really should not come as a surprise. The events leading to this conclusion were foreshadowed in a Career Day presentation I did at my local Middle School. I was doing a live demo, so a week before the presentation, I went in to test things on a student Chromebook.

I sat down with a Chromebook, logged in as a student. I could get to the internet, sort of, but not github.com where my code examples were stored. There was no Visual Studio Code app, but I didn't really expect that. But, the web-accessible version of Visual Studio Code, vscode.dev, was blocked too.

All is not lost, I said to myself. My elder son had told me of the fabled Chromebook Linux mode, so I had not hit rock botton yet. Surely I could run VS Code in Linux mode, right? Wrong. Administrative policies prevent it.

The demo worked out, albeit with a lot of plan Bs.

After all this, the wheels in my head were turning. Surely the school must have some retired Chromebooks gathering dust that could be reformatted with a standard Linux OS. Wrong again. The devices are leased and get returned after their useful lifespan. More e-waste. Yay!

But wait! There must be a computer lab somewhere in the school with proper PCs or Macs attached to glorious 4K displays, right? Wrong. (This is the third time, in case you're keeping track.) School budgets being what they are, these more expensive computing options are nowhere to be found.

So I'm down, but not out. I've got some older Raspberry Pi 3s and three months to put a plan together before students return. That's what this repository is all about.
