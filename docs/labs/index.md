## Hands-On Labs
Plug your microcontroller into your Raspberry Pi workstation and get ready.
This section is alabout learning by doing.

## Learning Labs
The goal of these labs is to get you familiar with a piece of hardware
or a particular coding technique. They produce a result, but it's not
always super interesting on its own. The idea is to take what you learn
in these labs and apply it to a larger project.

Labs are ordered from simple to more complex, but feel free to tackle
them in any order you wish.

1. [Intro to MicroPython on ESP32](Intro%20to%20MicroPython%20on%20ESP32.md) 
   Learn the basics of writing MicroPython programs on ESP32 hardware.
2. [Intro to GPIO output](Intro%20to%20GPIO%20output.md)
   Interact with the outside world by controlling General Purpose Input/Output
   (GPIO) pins.
3. [Intro to Displays](Intro%20to%20Displays.md)
   Use a small OLED display to display numbers and text.
4. Intro to I2C
5. Intro to multiple Neopixels
6. Intro to GPIO input
7. Intro to GPIO interrupts

## Project Labs
These labs focus on building a project to do something useful. They
combine and build on the concepts in the Learning Labs to make
something new. Most will guide you through the first steps and leave
the last bit for you to figure out on your own.
