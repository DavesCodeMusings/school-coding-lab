## Hands-On Labs
Plug your microcontroller into your Raspberry Pi workstation and get ready.
This section is alabout learning by doing.

## Feature-Specific Labs
The goal of these labs is to get you familiar with a piece of hardware
or a particular coding technique. They produce a result, but it's not
always super interesting on its own. The idea is to take what you learn
in these labs and apply it to a larger project.

Labs are ordered from simple to more complex, but feel free to tackle
them in any order you wish.

1. [MicroPython on ESP32](MicroPython%20on%20ESP32.md) 
   Learn the basics of writing MicroPython programs on ESP32 hardware.
2. [GPIO output](GPIO%20Output.md)
   Interact with the outside world by controlling General Purpose Input/Output
   (GPIO) pins.
3. [Displays](Displays.md)
   Use a small OLED display to display numbers and text.
4. I2C Protocol
5. Multiple Neopixels
6. GPIO input
7. GPIO interrupts
8. Optical Sensors

## Project-Based Labs
These labs focus on multiple development iterations to do something
useful. They combine and build on the concepts in the Learning Labs to
make something new. Most will guide you through the first steps and
leave the last bit for you to figure out on your own.

### Urban Planner
You're working for the city. Your job is to install traffic signals
to keep the citizens safe.
1. Traffic Light
2. Cross Traffic
3. Walk Signal

### Off to the Races
Grab some Hot Wheels cars and let's see how fast they go.
1. Detecting a Passing Car
2. Determining Time Difference
3. Calculating Speed
4. Best Time Board

### Meteorologist for a Day
Build a weather station that measures temperature, humidity, and
barometric pressure. Make predictions on what tomorrow's weather
will be based on the information you gather.
1. Measure the Environment
2. Share the Information
3. Make Weather Predictions

### An Internet of Our Own
If you've ever wondered how those adorable cat pictures get to your
web browser, this series of labs will show how it works.
1. ESP32 WiFi Access Point
2. ESP32 Web Server
3. Consumer WiFi Router comparison
4. Domain Name Service

### Home Automation
Keep your classroom lab comfortable year round with home automation.
Just kidding! The school will never let you control the HVAC system,
but it's fun to pretend.
1. Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi
2. Sensors Using ESPHome
3. Sending Sensor Data Over MQTT
