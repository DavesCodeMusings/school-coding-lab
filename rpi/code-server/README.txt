This is the Dockerfile used by GitHub Actions to create a web-based
VS Code environment with Python and VS Code Python extensions pre-
installed. You will also find a Docker Compose file that can be used
to run it.

The container is only compatible with ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 3 and up)
or x86_64 (AMD/Intel PC)

The container image is available from both Docker Hub and GitHub
Container Resgistry.
