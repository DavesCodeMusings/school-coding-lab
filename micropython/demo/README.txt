A demo that involves changing a lightning storm into a rainbow.

Use the predefined COLOR_ constants, and a bit of ingenuity, to
change the violently flashing white NeoPixels into a soothing
multi-color display.

This is intended to be a volunteer / instructor-led activity.
Start with lightning.py. Comment out the while loop that makes
the lightning flash. Add in colors of the rainbow one at a time
to demonstrate how each individual pixel can be controlled. The
end result should look like rainbow.py.
