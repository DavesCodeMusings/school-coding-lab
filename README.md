# School Coding Lab
_Creating a student development environment on the cheap!_

This repository is a combination of [documentation](https://davescodemusings.github.io/school-coding-lab/) and [microcontroller project code](micropython) and it's all about building a computing environment for hands-on learning.

Start with the [documentation](https://davescodemusings.github.io/school-coding-lab/) to discover how it all works.
