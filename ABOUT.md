# About the School Coding Lab
Here is where you will find the management speak you might need to get this kind of project started in your own school.

## Vision
Every student has the tools and knowledge build and maintain their own hands-on computing lab.

## Mission
Accelerate student hands-on learning with upcycled hardware and open-source software.

## Executive Summary
Learning to code in middle school is rough. Chromebook administrative policies prevent students from installing software. Internet access policies can prevent students from exploring common open-source developer sites (e.g. github.com.) Building an air-gapped (isolated) network of inexpensive Raspberry Pis lets students explore with the guard rails off and still stay safe in today's always-connected world.

### Upcycling Hardware
The computing lab starts with donated Raspberry Pis and an old laptop or two. Technology evolves at an incredible pace. Last year's top of the line hardware is today's middle or low-tier. But that's no reason to send it off as e-waste. Students will create their own computer lab using last generation hardware donated by technology enthusiasts in the community.

### Learning to Code
Every copy of Raspberry Pi OS includes the Python programming language and the tools needed to get started with it. And, by building and maintaining their own lab, students will learn configuration management languages and automation techniques.

### Builing an Internet of Things
Beyond the programming capabilities of the Rasberry Pi, students will extend their knowledge of Python programming to build and interact with connected devices in their environment. Today's inexpensive WiFi capable microcontrollers and a wide variety of sensors allow experiments that extend beyond the confines of the computer into the physical world.

## Why does this require funding?
By relying on donations, you're not going to get everything you need. There will be microSD cards required for Raspberry Pis. Maybe even monitors, keyboards, and mice. Cables and power supplies will need to be purchased. Microcontroller boards and sensors, though usually under $10(US), can add up quickly when providing enough for a group.

## Next Steps
As this project contiues to develop, more information will be added here to help.
