# Code Editors
Before you can run code, you have to write code. For that, you need a code editor. There are many choices, but for Python and MicroPython, Thonny is an excellent choice. And, comes pre-installed with Raspberry Pi OS, so you can start coding right away.

## Thonny in Five Minutes
Thonny can be accessed from the Raspberry Pi OS application menu as shown in the screenshot below.
