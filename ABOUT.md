# About the School Coding Lab
Here is where you will find the management speak you might need to get this kind of project started in your own school.

## Vision
Every student has the tools and knowledge to build and maintain their own hands-on computing lab.

## Mission
Accelerate student hands-on learning with upcycled hardware and open-source software.

## Executive Summary
Learning to code in middle school is rough. Chromebook administrative policies prevent students from installing software. Internet access policies can prevent students from exploring common open-source developer sites (e.g. github.com.) Building an air-gapped (isolated) network of inexpensive Raspberry Pis lets students explore with the guard rails off and still stay safe in today's always-connected world.

### Upcycling Hardware
The computing lab starts with donated Raspberry Pis and an old laptop or two. Technology evolves at an incredible pace. Last year's top of the line hardware is today's middle or low-tier. But that's no reason to send it off as e-waste. Students will create their own computer lab using last generation hardware donated by technology enthusiasts in the community.

### Learning to Code
Every copy of Raspberry Pi OS includes the Python programming language and the tools needed to get started with it. And, by building and maintaining their own lab, students will learn configuration management languages, automation techniques, and modern DevOps methodologies.

### Builing an Internet of Things
Beyond the programming capabilities of the Rasberry Pi, students will extend their knowledge of Python programming to build and interact with connected devices in their environment. Today's inexpensive WiFi capable microcontrollers and a wide variety of sensors allow experiments that push beyond the confines of the computer into the physical world.

## Why does this require funding?
By relying on donations, you're not going to get everything you need. There will be commodity items such as microSD cards, USB cables, and power supplies that are needed. There are also the microcontroller boards and sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT) labs. Though usually under $10(US) a piece, these items can add up quickly when providing enough for a group.

### What will need to be purchased?
Here's a list to get started. It is by no means complete.
* 32G high endurance microSD cards for Raspberry Pis
* 5V/3A power supplies for Raspberry Pis
* HDMI monitors, USB keyboards, and USB mice for Raspberry Pis
* Espressif ESP32C microcontrollers
* USB cables for ESP32C microcontrollers
* Sensors for interfacing to ESP32 microcontrollers

## Next Steps
As this project contiues to develop, more information will be added here to help.
