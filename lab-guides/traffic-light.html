        It's your first day on the job with the city transportation
        department and already there's a problem. Watch the video
        voicemail from your supervisor to find out what's going on.
        Then, scroll down to the notes from your coworker to
        discover how you can fix it.

            I just got a call from the mayor. All the traffic signals
            in the city are flashing red. With your programming skills,
            we're hoping you can get this problem sorted. Have a look
            at the code in Visual Studio and see if you can make a proper
            traffic light sequence.
        </p>
    </details>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>
        Fortunately, your coworker has left some documentation on
        the traffic light system. Take a look at the notes below.
    </p>

        <li>Link to system login (secure shell): <a id="shellinabox" href="https://10.42.0.1:4200">https://10.42.0.1:4200</a></li>

    <h3>Flashing Red Code</h3>

    <p>
        The traffic light code is written in MicroPython. Whenever the
        system has a problem, it reverts back to flashing red so everyone
        is forced to stop and there are no fender benders.
    </p>

    <p>Here's the code for that:</p>

    <figure>
        <!-- All whitespace is rendered as-is in the code-block. This includes leading indents. -->
        <code class="code-block">
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

red = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
yellow = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
green = Pin(6, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>

        <figcaption>MicroPython code for flashing red traffic light.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        You'll also find a copy in the <i>~/Code</i> directory on your
        development workstation. It's in the traffic_light subdirectory.
    </p>

    <p>
        It works by using the microcontroller General Purpose Input Output
        (GPIO) pins to control the red, yellow, and green signal lights.
        In flashing red mode, only the GPIO pin controlling red is cycled
        on and off. Yellow and green stay off.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a <code>sleep()</code> function that controls how many
        seconds to pause before executing the next step. And the whole
        thing is wrapped in a <code>while True:</code> loop to make it
        run forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        Basically, it works like this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> red on, all other lights off</li>
        <li>wait one second</li>
        <li>red (and everything else) off</li>
        <li>wait another second</li>
        <li>repeat</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Testing the Code</h3>

    <p>
        You can run MicroPython code by logging in through
        secure shell as the <i>student</i> user account,
        changing to the <i>Code/traffic_light</i>
        directory, and using the command:
        <code>mpremote run traffic_light.py</code>
    </p>

    <p>Here's an example of what that would look like:</p>

    <figure>
        <code class="code-block">
login: student
password: ********

pi:~$ cd Code
pi:~/Code$ cd traffic_light
pi:~/Code/traffic_light$ mpremote run traffic_light.py
        </code>

        <figcaption>Logging into the Raspberry Pi to run the code.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Press CTRL+C to get the command prompt back.</p>

    <p>
        After making changes to the code, repeat the
        <code>mpremote run traffic_light.py</code> command to run it
        again.
    </p>

    <h3>Updating the Code</h3>

    <p>
        There was code written for the regular traffic light sequence,
        but it never got uploaded to the server. And to make matters
        worse, the laptop where it was saved got left unattended in the
        airport and was taken out to the tarmac and blown up by TSA.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, you'll have to start over again. Shouldn't be too hard though.
        Just remember the GPIO <code>on()</code> and <code>off()</code>
        methods and the <code>sleep()</code> function to control the
        delay time.
    </p>

    <h2>Hints</h2>

    <p>
        If you get stuck, here are some things that can help you.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>What needs to be changed?</summary>

        <p>
            All of the code at the top of the program (the
            <code>from import</code> statements and the
            <code>Pin()</code> assignments) can be left as-is. The
            changes you want to make are part of the
            <code>while True:</code> loop.
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)            

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)            
        </code>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How can green and yellow be lit up?</summary>

        <p>
            Take the example of the flashing red. It looks like this:
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)            

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>
        <p>
            Change it so the second block turns on green LED.
            Like this:
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
                    
    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.on()
    sleep(1)
        </code>

        <p>
            Now when you run the program, the sequence should be:
            red, green, repeat.
        </p>

        <p>
            It works the same way for yellow. Just copy and paste the
            code block and adjust the on / off.
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
                    
    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.on()
    sleep(1)

    red.off()
    yellow.on()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How can the timing be more like a real traffic signal?</summary>

        <p>
            A typical traffic light runs like this: red, green, yellow
            for a short time, and then back to red. Structure your code
            blocks to light the LEDs in this sequence. Then, use the
            values inside the <code>sleep()</code> function to adjust
            how long to wait for the next change.
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
while True:
    red.on()
    yellow.off()
    green.off()
    sleep(5)

    red.off()
    yellow.off()
    green.on()
    sleep(4)

    red.off()
    yellow.on()
    green.off()
    sleep(1)
        </code>
