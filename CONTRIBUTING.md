# Contributing to the Project
Thank you for your interest and your willingness to help!

To keep things managable, please use the GitLab issues to point out
bugs or to suggest enhancements. Doing this in the beginning, instead
of just a pull request, will help make sure everything fits and helps
minimize wasted effort and rework.

Things to keep in mind:
* Plan to release your contributions to the Public Domain.
* Be prepared that not all contributions will be accepted.
* You're also free to fork the repo and do your own thing.
