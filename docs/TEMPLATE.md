# A Template You Can Use
This template will help you structure your documentation contributions. The paragraph (or paragraphs) here should serve as a short introduction to your document. The title (shown above) should be a level-one heading and written in [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case). The filename for your document should be an abreviated version of the title.

If there are prerequisites, list them here in a bulleted list.
* First thing
* Second thing
* Third

## Background Information (Optional)
If your document requires more introduction than can be reasonably fit into a few paragraphs under the title, put it here. Try to keep it short and to the point, using links to external sources rather than re-writing information. Try not to overwhelm the reader with excessive detail.

Use a level-two heading for this.

## First Major Task
Most documents here will be focused on doing something. Try to break your overall document into a handful of these tasks. If the tasks can be broken down further, use numbered lists when the order matters and bulleted lists when order is unimportant.

For example:
1. Turn on the water.
2. Get your hands wet.
3. Apply soap.
4. Sing the ABCs as you wash.

You may also use one of the following alternatives in place of the ABCs song:
* The intro to Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance
* The chorus to Jolene by Dolly Parton
* The chorus to Africa by Toto

If your list is a complete sentence, end it with a period. If it's a fragment, leave the period off. You may also leave punctuation off at the end of system commands, like `sudo raspi-config` to avoid confusion about what should be typed and what's part of the document.

## Second Major Task
The next high-level step goes here. Again, use the second-level heading for this. If you have sub-tasks that require more than a sentence or two to describe, use a third-level heading below this.

### Finding Your Own Song
There's nothing that says you have to use one of the songs above while washing your hands. In fact, there are plenty of web sites out there that offer lists. The important part is the timing. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend [at least twenty seconds](https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html). Find a part of any song that speaks to your heart and check that it's at least this long.

### Something Else to Note
If you're going to have one level-three heading, it should be followed by another. Otherwise, it could have been part of the major task instead of being broken out into a separate sub-heading.

### One More Thing
When you use acronyms and initialisms, like CDC, spell them out first so your reader is not left wondering. Use links to external sources to help with this, particularly for things that are less common.

## Third Major Task
Try to limit your document to three to five tasks. More than that can become tedious to read. If you find it difficult to do, consider reducing the scope of your document.

If you use screenshots or pictures, make sure to consider these aspects:
* Use public domain images or images you've created yourself and are willing to release to public domain.
* Separate your images from the test with horizontal bars above and below (three consecutive underscores in Markdown.)
* Add a caption in italic text with Figure X: denoting the number of the image, folloed by a short description in title case.
* Use relative links to a common image directory and filenames that reflect what the image is about.

## Next Steps
Please, do not end your document with a Conclusion section. This habit should die shortly after eight grade English, but yet it persists. You're wrting a document to teach a topic. Learning never stops. Your document should not stop either.

Do the reader a favor and point them to additional topics that logically follow what your document covers. They can be something you've written or a link to an external source. For an example, look at the [Raspberry Pi First-Time Install document](rpi/fresh_install.md).
