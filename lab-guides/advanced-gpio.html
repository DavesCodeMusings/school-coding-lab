        After the Traffic Light Controller seminar, the traffic light vendor
        has been getting a lot of follow-up questions asking about GPIOs and
        voltages and how it all works together to make the traffic light
        module's LEDs light up. If there's enough interest, they've agreed
        to offer another, advanced seminar on GPIOs.

            We had a really good turn out for the traffic light hardware
            cross-training seminar. And a lot of folks wanted to learn more,
            particularly about the the microcontroller GPIOs and how they
            work. The traffic light manufacturer has agreed to host another
            seminar and the mayor's office says there's money in the budget.
            So once again, we're opening this up to the hardware team and
            software developers alike.
