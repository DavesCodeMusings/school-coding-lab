        <h2>Traffic Light</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="images/traffic-light.jpg" alt="traffic signal">
            It's your first day on the job with the city transportation
            department and all the traffic lights are flashing red. It's
            up to you as a software developer to fix the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            An introduction to MicroPython and the development environment.

        <h2>Traffic Light Controller</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="images/traffic-light-controller.jpg" alt="microcontroller board">
            After learning about how the city's traffic light software works,
            it's time to round out your skills, learning about the hardware
            and how it works with software to light up the signal lights.
        </p>

        <p>
            An introduction to microcontroller General-Purpose Input/Output
            (GPIO), and how software controls the state of microcontroller
            pins connected to the Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).

        <h2>Walk Signal</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="images/walk-signal.jpg" alt="close-up of NeoPixel on microcontroller">
            You've learned about GPIOs and how they use 3.3 volt and 0 volt
            signals to turn the traffic light LEDs on and off. Now, take it
            to the next level and use the ESP32-C3 built-in NeoPixel LED to
            act as a walk signal.
        </p>

        <p>
            An introduction to the NeoPixel LED and how to combine separate
            traffic light and walk signal programs into a single cohesive
            piece of code that synchronizes both transitions.

        <h2>Walk Signal Request</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="images/walk-request.jpg" alt="close-up of Boot button on microcontroller">

            Use the boot button as a GPIO input to request a walk signal.
            Both with polling and interrupt methods.
